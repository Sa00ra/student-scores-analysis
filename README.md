# Student Scores Analysis ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of student scores across Math, Science, and English.
The goal was to clean the data, categorize performance levels, visualize patterns,
and explore relationships between subjects.

## Objectives
- Handle missing values
- Create new columns for performance categories
- Visualize score distributions and averages
- Perform correlation analysis between subjects

## Skills & Tools Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** for data cleaning & manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding

## Key Insights
- Students with "Excellent" performance scored highest in all subjects.
- Math and Science scores showed a strong positive correlation.
- English scores were moderately correlated with Math, less so with Science.
- Score distributions revealed subject-specific patterns and outliers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-scores-analysis.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook student_scores_analysis.ipynb
3. Run all cells to reproduce results.
